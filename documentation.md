#Documentation

A simple landing page using NextJs and Typescript. Additionally

#####Stack selection
Front-end - NextJs and Typescript
Back-end - NodeJs and Express and MongoDB

###Why NodeJS and Express and MongoDB
1. First of all, I have 2.6 years of experience in writing NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.
2. Everything can be written with JavaScript.(both Frontend and Backend)
2. Can handle multiple concurrent request due to non-blocking async event driven model.
3. I have written Flask. But NodeJS is more structured than Flask.
4. Express is fast, unopionated, minimalist framwork.


####Why don't I include these features
1. I didn't do the form validation properly since I don't have enough time to decorate each field. To cover this, I use a toast and show all error messages in one toast.
2. I don't use State Management since I assume there is no state to handle.
3. I only use Axios in Register Page. So I don't use Redux Toolkit Query or some other api handling.
